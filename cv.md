 _PC_, _program_, _design_, this was always in my life, I start learning _HTML_ and _CSS_ when I was in school, but due to my family, I go to another specialty. 
 That's how I become a seaman, but stop learning something new in my soul mate work. But after this many years I still love all this, thatâ€™s why I sign-in __FroentEnd/JS__ 
 courses and beginning my road to my goals. Because of my profession I am well _disciplined_, _assiduous_, _persistent_ and _rather stubborn_. I'm sure this will help me to reach 
 my goals.
